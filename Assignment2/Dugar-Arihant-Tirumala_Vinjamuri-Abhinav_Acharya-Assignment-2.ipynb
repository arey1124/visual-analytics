You will continue using the [breast cancer dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html#sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer). Make use of code examples available in the Dash tutorial and Plotly documentation, and clearly reference the URLs of the classes / methods you reused."

    "Before you start this assignment, study the Dash in 20 minutes tutorial and replicate the examples in a notebook. Skip the examples that require a Dash Enterprise license. Look up the documentation of the methods and libraries used. A particularly useful library is [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/), which supports the most common plot types, with interactive controls. The [Plotly Express cheat sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/plotly-express-cheat-sheet) is useful. Aman has put together a [resource document](https://csci6612.notion.site/VA-Course-TA-Suggestions-3d264e87fb1c4ce48a83dc7af11b7fb8?pvs=4) on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) that he will keep updating as the course advances.

    "10 pairs of features along with reasons for their potential utility and observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Radius and Mean Perimeter**: These features are likely correlated, as larger mean radii would result in larger mean perimeters. The combination of these features may help distinguish tumor size, which can be crucial for classification.\n",
    "   <br>**Observation**: It shows some degree of separation between the classes, but it also has overlapping values, indicating that it may not be a perfect separator\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Texture and Mean Smoothness**: Texture and smoothness might provide complementary information about the tumor's characteristics. Higher texture with lower smoothness could indicate malignancy.\n",
    "   <br>**Observation**: It has mixed and scattered distribution of values with some overlap, making it a challenging pair for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mean Perimeter and Mean Area**: A combination of perimeter and area could capture the tumor's overall shape. Malignant tumors might have larger perimeters for their respective areas, leading to a potential classification criterion.\n",
    "    <br>**Observation**: Displays separation between the classes, but it also has some overlapping values and a few outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mean Compactness and Mean Concavity**: Compactness and concavity could jointly represent how irregular and compact the tumor is. High compactness and high concavity could indicate malignancy.\n",
    "   <br>**Observation**: It shows clear separation between the classes with some overlapping values, but the values are spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mean Concavity and Mean Concave Points**: Combining these features can provide information on the severity and number of concave portions. Elevated values in both may signify malignant tumors.\n",
    "   <br>**Observation**: It shows clear separation and some overlapping values, though the values are widely dispersed, which may affect classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mean Symmetry and Mean Smoothness**: The combination of symmetry and smoothness may capture the overall regularity of the tumor's surface. Lower symmetry and smoothness could suggest malignancy.\n",
    "    <br>**Observation**: It has mixed and scattered distribution of values with some overlap, making it a challenging pair for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Worst Radius and Worst Perimeter**: These features represent the largest values for radius and perimeter, respectively. Larger values for both could indicate malignant tumors.\n",
    "    <br>**Observation**: There is separation between classes, but some overlapping values and outliers are present, particularly among higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Worst Texture and Worst Smoothness**: Combining the worst texture and worst smoothness may capture the extreme values in texture and smoothness. Higher worst texture and lower worst smoothness could be indicative of malignancy.\n",
    "    <br>**Observation**: It has mixed and scattered distribution of values with some overlap, making it a challenging pair for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Worst Perimeter and Worst Area**: The largest perimeter combined with the largest area may provide insight into the overall size and shape of the tumor. High values for both could signal malignancy.\n",
    "    <br>**Observation**: It has clear separation between classes and might be highly useful for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Worst Compactness and Worst Concavity**: Combining worst compactness and worst concavity may offer information on the irregularity and compactness of the tumor's concave portions. Higher values for both features might be associated with malignancy.\n",
    "    <br>**Observation**: It shows clear separation between the classes, but it also has some overlapping values and a few outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These feature pairs are selected based on the assumption that they might collectively capture different aspects of tumor characteristics, such as size, shape, regularity, and irregularity, which are crucial for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. However, thorough feature selection and model training are necessary to confirm their actual significance in a classification task."

    "#### Comment on how distinct the clusters are:\n",
    "1. It appears that the two classes are quite distinct. The points from each class form separate clusters, with minimal overlap. This suggests that the UMAP projection has successfully captured the structure of the data in a way that separates the classes. \n",
    "2. We could conclude that, as value increases on the `X` axis the probability of a cell being malignant (cancerous) decreased. The lower the value was the higher the chances were of a cell being cancerous. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comment on the visual variability of the results:\n",
    "1. Although the shape of clusters in each iteration changes slightly, its important that the structure and relationship between clusters and points are preserved properly, which is clearly evident from looking at all the 5 graphs.\n",
    "2. When it comes to the differences between the overall shape of the clusters, it could be due to the fact that UMAP is a stochastic algorithm which incorporates random elements such as stochastic gradient descent which is used in optimizing the low dimensional graph, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences between UMAP and T-SNE:\n",
    "1. The first difference is how the low dimensional graph is formulated. In T-SNE the points (scatter points) are randomly arranged on a straight line, whereas in UMAP the initialization of low dimensional graph is based on spectral embedding of the scatter points. It means to say that if we were to perform T-SNE on a dataset multiple times, we would end up with different low-dimensional graphs each time, but with UMAP the low dimensional graph would be the same each time.\n",
    "2. In T-SNE's iteration to order the low dimensional graph, all the points need to move at once, whereas in UMAP can either move 1 point, or a subset of n number of points. This makes UMAP helpful for large datasets. T-SNE is computationally expensive and may not scale well for large datasets. \n",
    "3. The way similarity scores are calculated in both T-SNE and UMAP are different. In UMAP, the similarity scores are calculated by considering n-nearest neighbors, wheras in T-SNE it is calculated using the distance between clusters.\n",
    "4. In terms of visualization, T-SNE cannot accurately represent the distance between clusters, i.e., it places the clusters on the low dimensional graph far away from where it was supposed to be in the higher dimensional graph. In UMAP, we can accurately visualize the distance (boundaries) between clusters in the low dimensional graphs.\n",
    "5. In comparison to the T-SNE graph from assignment-1, it was clear that UMAP was able to scale the distance (boundary) between the two clusters better than T-SNE.\n",
    "6. The data points in the T-SNE image are scattered around the center of the plot, with one cluster being more spread out than the other. In contrast, the data points in the UMAP image form two distinct lines with positive and negative slopes."
